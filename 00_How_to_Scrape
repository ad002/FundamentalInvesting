#1. On homepage, find what you are looking for and copy/paste keyword 
    beloning to the value you want to scrape
#2. View page source, CMD+F plus keyword to find it in code
#3. Find what is on either side of the value on source code 
    #in this case: Price/Book</span><!-- react-text: 59 --> <!-- /react-text --><!-- react-text: 60 -->(mrq)<!-- /react-text --><sup aria-label="KS_HELP_SUP_undefined" data-reactid="61"></sup></td><td class="Fz(s) Fw(500) Ta(end)" data-reactid="62">
    #and </td> at the end and in between is our value (10.17 in that case)
#4. #Copy all from Price/Book to the value, split source code at that point
    #and mark it as element one so all BEFORE the Price/Book will be the
    #[0] element, Price/Book and all behind will be element [1], right 
    #now including our value 10,17 so we'll do another split by the closing
    #tag behind the value (</td>) and then the value 10,17 will be the 
    #[0] element or the first element
    
#5. What this does is split all the source code from all to the top 
    #until the value 10.17 and then split again what comes after it and 
    #put these elements in  a list
