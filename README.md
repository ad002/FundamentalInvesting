#1 Web Scraping 
We scrape Yahoo Finance website for price to book ratio 

Price= What is the publics evaluation of the company value? 

-> #of stocks x price per stock
 
Book = If this company was to go out of business and sell everything the own, how much money
would they have left after paying back the debters? (and maybe after that some of the stock
owners get their money back).  

-> Value of company's tangible assets - liabilities (debt etc.)
-> You need price to book ratio of 0 to get your money back for sure 
-> low PtB Ratio: Undervalued or something is very very wrong with the company
-> if <1 and you can't figure out why: Better leave the company behind
-> In case of tech companies and finance firms etc. you often can't figure out what their 
   assets to sell are so if you don't understand, leave it behind
-> Chipotle had a 9,22 price to book ratio. You know what they have when they sell like all 
   their restaurants and whats inside the restaurants and so on 
-> Traditionally, any value under 1.0 is considered a good P/B value, indicating a potentially undervalued stock. 
   However, value investors often consider stocks with a P/B value under 3.0.
