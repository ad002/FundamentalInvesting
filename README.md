"Value investors have a longer time horizon. They may hold stocks for decades, and they aren't worried if the stock's price drops in the short run or about the speed or percentage rate at which the company is growing. Like value investors, growth investors care about the underlying company's profit margins."

[%%%Web Scraping and P/B ratio%%% (PART II in Playlist)]
We scrape Yahoo Finance website for price to book ratio 

Price= What is the publics evaluation of the company value? 

-> number of stocks X price per stock = Market Capitlization 
 
Book = If this company was to go out of business and sell everything the own, how much money
would they have left after paying back the debters? (and maybe after that some of the stock
owners get their money back).  

-> Value of company's tangible assets - liabilities (debt etc.)
-> You need price to book ratio of 0 to get your money back for sure in case of (?)
-> low PtB Ratio: Undervalued or something is very very wrong with the company
-> if <1 and you can't figure out why: Better leave the company behind
-> not a surefiremethod, could also happen that they just have great problems or a fundamental flaw in the business
-> in case of yahoo it's twice of price to book which is quite low for a tech company but they are still worth double of what their actual tangible assets - their liabilities are 
-> In case of tech companies and finance firms etc. you often can't figure out what their 
   assets to sell are so 
-> if you don't understand, leave it behind
-> Chipotle had a 9,22 price to book ratio (had back then when video published, 2013) . You know what they have when they sell like all 
   their restaurants and whats inside the restaurants and so on 
[-> When it comes to value investing you look for something like 2/3 P/B ratio] 
-> Like their price is 2/3 of their tangible value | Clearly undervalued 
-> so if they sold everything they would still have 33% percent of their value that they could give to shareholders 
-> you would need a price to book ratio of 0 to get your money back for sure 
-> ["Traditionally, any value under 1.0 is considered a good P/B value, indicating a potentially undervalued stock. 
   However, value investors often consider stocks with a P/B value under 3.0."]

[%%%Stocks only with PEG (price/earning  to growth) ratio less than one%%% (PART V in Playlist)]

"The P/E ratio helps investors determine the market value of a stock as compared to the company's earnings. In short, the P/E shows what the market is willing to pay today for a stock based on its past or future earnings. A high P/E could mean that a stock's price is high relative to earnings and possibly overvalued. Conversely, a low P/E might indicate that the current stock price is low relative to earnings.

For example, at the end of 2018, Bank of America Corporation (BAC) closed the year showing the following: 
EPS = $2.61 (earnings per share/Gewinn per Aktie)
Share Price = $24.57 
The Bank of America's P/E ratio was: P/E 9.41 or 24.57/2.61

In other words, the bank was trading at roughly nine times earnings. However, the 9.41 P/E by itself is not a helpful indicator unless it is compared with something else. A common comparison could be to the stock's industry group, a benchmark index, or the historical P/E range of a stock."

Since stock prices are typically based on investor expectations of future performance by a company, the PEG ratio can be helpful but is best used when comparing if a stock price is overvalued or undervalued based on the growth in the company's industry. 

Stock theory suggests that the stock market should assign a PEG ratio of one to every stock. This would represent the theoretical equilibrium between the market value of a stock and anticipated earnings growth. For example, a stock with an earnings multiple of 20 (P/E of 20) and 20% anticipated earnings growth would have a PEG ratio of one."

-> Video consideres P/E to growth ratio within 5 years ([what yahoo finance portal provides or provided back then. So: Re-Check if closer timeframes possible until now])
-> a price to book ratio perfectly one would represent a "fair" value in accordance to price to earnings to growth 
-> you wouldn't want a company that has a Price to Earnings ratio (P/E) less than one as this represents a "stupid" investement / business model that doesn't return in profit
-> Consider also that profitability can suffer during growth as some processes and operations like for example expanding your store network will cost "initial" cash and produces more or less fewer and more stable costs when in operation
-> so maybe they invested right now and will "earn their fruits" later on 
-> In the S&P 500 the growth will be fairly minimal as they are top dogs and also some kind of established (and but for sure not as agile and rapidly as StartUps starting from scratch/zero) 
-> also compared to a company that just had an IPO (Initial Public Offering)
-> also we'll find some with significant growth as companies are always eager to earn more and more 

-> With value investing we consider companies that are right now undervalued and note "fairly" represented by their market-/stockprice
-> so we are eager to find [PEB ratio less than one] 
-> Theory also represented in Peter Lynch: One up on wall street 
[%%% The P/E Ratio of a company that's fairly priced is gonna equal it's growth rate! %%%]
-> When the P/E ratio let's say people are paying 10 times earnings and you have a growth rate of 10% then now you have a fair priced company
-> P/E rate is 10 and growth is 20% now we're cooking we're talking about a 1.5 PEG ratio
[-> we want a PEG <1 and exclude negative -1 which woul mean negative growth]
-> people are maybe paying 10 times earnings but growth is -5% so it's giving you a negative -2 ratio also your earnings could decline and give you a negative PEG
-> find valuable companies that are undervalued
-> we are not looking for a company that's going to turnaround or may turn it around 
-> in the end you wanna compare PEG in your sector as PEGs in sectors can also vary a lot 
 
 
 
AS I'M NOT IN POSESSION OF LARGE AMOUNTS OF CASH TO INVEST IN LONG TERM I'LL SWITCH OVER TO DAY TRADING AND TECHNICAL ANALYSIS AND FOUND OUT SENTDEX ALSO HAS A GREAT TUTORIAL ON THAT
